1.Given a Python list, Write a program to add all its elements into a given set.

Given:

sample_set = {"Yellow", "Orange", "Black"}
sample_list = ["Blue", "Green", "Red"]

2.Return a new set of identical items from two sets
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}

Expected output:

{40, 50, 30}

3.Write a Python program to return a new set with unique items from both sets by removing duplicates.

Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{70, 40, 10, 50, 20, 60, 30}

4.Update the first set with items that donâ€™t exist in the second set
Given two Python sets, write a Python program to update the first set with items that exist only in the first set and not in the second set.

Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30}
set2 = {20, 40, 50}
Expected output:

set1 {10, 30}

5.Remove items from the set at once
Write a Python program to remove items 10, 20, 30 from the following set at once.

Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Expected output:

{40, 50}

6.Return a set of elements present in Set A or B, but not both
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{20, 70, 10, 60}

7.Check if two sets have any elements in common. If yes, display the common elements
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {60, 70, 80, 90, 10}
Expected output:

Two sets have items in common
{10}

8.Update set1 by adding items from set2, except common items
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{70, 10, 20, 60}

9.Remove items from set1 that are not common to both set1 and set2
Given:

set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
Expected output:

{40, 50, 30}
